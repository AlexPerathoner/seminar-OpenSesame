## Why use OpenSesame

Now more than ever, what was previously amazing native apps have become slow and big web apps. Big apps take more control away from the user and push subscriptions and other payment models without much reason. OpenSesame aims to fix that by giving a free and open source password manager that is native and performant. Still get all the great features of other password managers without all the baggage.
